# Adaptive genomic strategies modulate nutrient-stress resilience

### Abstract
The molecular interplay between energy conservation and evolutionary adaptation is not fully understood. Here, we use a functional genomics approach to investigate how energy conservation states modulate transcriptional compartments and resilient phenotypes linked to human accelerated regions (HARs) - rapidly evolving genomic elements. We discover that adipocytes facilitate organismal adaptations via metabolic HARs (mHARs) genomic hubs and their cooperative regulators PGC1A, YY1, and CTCF. These adaptive mechanisms are affected by the distinctive genomic location, function, and disease-related genetic variations of these hubs, along with features within the protein regions of coactivators. In mice, mHAR-genomic hubs exhibit conserved phenotypic and structural relationships and are active during nutrient deficiency. This activation regulates chromatin contacts between these hubs and gene programs linked to lipid cycling. During prolonged fasting, this reduces lipotoxicity and oxidative stress, thereby preserving cellular plasticity. Adipose-tissue deletion of mHAR regulators impairs both acute and chronic fasting adaptations, leading to metabolic dysfunction and glucose intolerance. This effect is driven by NCOA7, an oxidative stress mediator that impairs lysosome function and transcriptional plasticity. In cellular models, these mechanisms influence PGC1A droplet plasticity during nutrient deficits, which regulates mHAR-genomic hubs and maintains metabolic homeostasis. These hubs exhibit a human-specific response to nutrient deficit, where multi-enhancer mHAR gene regulation suppresses disease-associated variants linked to the ANGPTL3 and PCSK9 genes. Overall, our study demonstrates that investigating evolutionary adaptations in specific transcriptional compartments uncovers functional hubs critical for nutrient-stress resilience, providing innovative strategies for therapeutic discovery in metabolic diseases.
